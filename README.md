[String Applet](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~jgeuenich/string-applet/)
============================================================================

The applet is bundled using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). For this to work:

  1. Make sure [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed.
  2. Execute `npm install` once.

Now there are two options:

  * `npm run debug` runs the applet on a local webserver *http://localhost:8080/*.
  * `npm run build` creates files in the directory *dist* that can be copied to a webserver.
